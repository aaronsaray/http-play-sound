# HTTP Play Sound

This is a very simple example or proof-of-concept of how you can receive a HTTP post request to play a sound.  My use case is that I have a HomeKit Homebridge virtual switch that can post a message when it's pressed.  The posted message will hit this software and then play a door chime sound. This will be running on a rapsberry pi with external speakers connected.
